 Bit Manipulation

This project focuses on bit manipulation in the C programming language. You will learn how to work with binary numbers and use bitwise operators to manipulate
individual bits. The tasks in this project will cover various aspects of bit manipulation.

Task 0

Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Task 1

Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Task 2

Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Task 3

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Task 4

Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Task 5

Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Task 6 (Advanced)

Write a function that checks the endianness.
Task 7 (Advanced)

Find the password for this program and save it in the file 101-password.
