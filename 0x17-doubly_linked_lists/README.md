### Doubly Linked Lists in C

This repository contains a set of C programs that demonstrate the implementation of doubly linked lists. Doubly linked lists are a data structure where each element, known as a node, contains a data element and two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node. This allows for efficient traversal in both directions.

#### List of Programs

    Print List: This program prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.

    List Length: Calculate the number of elements in a doubly linked list.

    Add Node at the Beginning: Add a new node at the beginning of the doubly linked list.

    Add Node at the End: Add a new node at the end of the doubly linked list.

    Get Node at Index: Retrieve a node at a specified index in the doubly linked list.

    Sum List: Calculate the sum of all the elements in the doubly linked list.

    Insert Node at Index: Insert a new node at a specified index in the doubly linked list.

    Delete Node at Index: Delete a node at a specified index in the doubly linked list.

    Crackme4: A program to find the password for a crackme, with the password saved in a file.

    Palindromes: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers and save it in a file.

    Crackme5 Keygen: A keygen program for crackme5, which generates valid keys for a given username.
