Function Pointers

This project focuses on understanding and implementing function pointers in the C programming language. Function pointers provide a way to store and manipulate references to functions, allowing for dynamic and flexible code execution.
Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will gain a deep understanding of function pointers and their usage. The key learning objectives include:

    Understanding what function pointers are and how to use them
    Knowing the purpose and content of a function pointer
    Identifying the memory location where function pointers point to

Project Overview

This project consists of several tasks that involve working with function pointers. Each task has specific requirements and constraints, including the allowed editors, coding style, and usage of certain C library functions. The tasks include:


Files and Directories

The project directory contains the following files and directories:

    0-print_name.c: Implementation of the function that prints a name using a function pointer.
    1-array_iterator.c: Implementation of the function that executes a given function on each element of an array.
    2-int_index.c: Implementation of the function that searches for an integer using a comparison function.
    3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h: Implementation files for the arithmetic operations program.
    100-main_opcodes.c: Implementation file for the program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.
