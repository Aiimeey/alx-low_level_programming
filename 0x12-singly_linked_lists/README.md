### Singly Linked Lists in C

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists. The programs are designed
 to achieve specific learning objectives related to data structures, linked lists, and memory management in C.

Project Structure

#### The project contains the following files:

    0-print_list.c: This file contains a function to print all the elements of a list_t list. The function returns the number of nodes in the list.

    1-list_len.c: This file contains a function that calculates and returns the number of elements in a list_t list.

    2-add_node.c: This file contains a function to add a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

    3-add_node_end.c: This file contains a function to add a new node at the end of a list_t list.

    4-free_list.c: This file contains a function to free all the nodes of a list_t list.

    100-first.c: This file contains a function that prints a specific message before the main function is executed.

    101-hello_holberton.asm: This assembly code file prints "Hello, Holberton" followed by a new line.

    lists.h: This header file contains the prototypes of all the functions used in the program.
