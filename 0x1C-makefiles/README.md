Project Title: C - Makefiles
Overview

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Makefiles in the C programming language. Makefiles are essential for managing and automating the build process of software projects. The tasks in this project cover the creation of Makefiles with increasing complexity and functionality.
Learning Objectives

By completing the tasks in this project, you will gain knowledge and proficiency in the following areas:

    Understanding the purpose and usage of Makefiles
    Creating rules and variables in Makefiles
    Implementing explicit and implicit rules
    Building a basic and useful Makefile structure
    Managing compilation and cleaning processes efficiently

Project Structure

    0-Makefile: Introduction to Makefiles. Builds an executable named "school" without any variables.
    1-Makefile: Introduces variables CC (compiler) and SRC (source files) to enhance flexibility.
    2-Makefile: Expands the Makefile with OBJ (object files) and NAME (executable name) variables.
    3-Makefile: Implements additional rules (clean, oclean, fclean, re) for better project management.
    4-Makefile: Enhances the Makefile with the CFLAGS variable for compiler flags, improving code quality.
    5-island_perimeter.py: Implements a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island in a grid.
    100-Makefile: An advanced Makefile with optimized rules, variables, and error handling.
