### C Dynamic Libraries

#### Description

In this project, we delve into the world of dynamic libraries in the C programming language. Dynamic libraries play a crucial role in modern
software development by allowing code to be shared and loaded at runtime, reducing redundancy and optimizing memory usage. This project aims
to familiarize you with the concept of dynamic libraries, their creation, and usage.

#### Project Tasks

    A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
        Create a dynamic library libdynamic.so containing various C functions.

    Without libraries, what have we? We have no past and no future
        Create a script that generates a dynamic library liball.so from multiple .c files in the current directory.

    Let's call C functions from Python (Advanced)
        Develop a dynamic library containing C functions that can be called from Python.

    Code injection: Win the Giga Millions! (Advanced)
        Create a shell script to manipulate a program, gm, to make you win the Giga Millions jackpot.
