#### C - Preprocessor

This repository contains solutions to the tasks related to the C preprocessor. The preprocessor is a powerful tool in C programming that performs various preprocessing tasks before the compilation of the code.
Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to understand and demonstrate the following concepts:

    Macros: Definition and usage of macros in C programming.
    Predefined Macros: Understanding and utilizing common predefined macros.
    Include Guard: Implementing include guards to prevent multiple inclusion of header files.

Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple files, each focusing on a specific task. The tasks and their corresponding files are as follows:

    Object-like Macro: 0-object_like_macro.h
        Definition of a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

    Pi: 1-pi.h
        Definition of a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

    File Name: 2-main.c
        A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

    Function-like Macro: 3-function_like_macro.h
        Definition of a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

    SUM: 4-sum.h
        Definition of a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of two numbers x and y.
